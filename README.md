# PSPowerHour

## What is PowerHour?

Think of this like a virtual PowerShell User Group, with a lightning-demo format, and room for non-PowerShell-specific content

### Where do we watch!

We'll be streaming on [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCtHKcGei3EjxBNYQCFZ3WNQ)

### How do I submit a demo proposal?

Just [submit an issue](https://github.com/PSPowerHour/PSPowerHour/issues/new)!  We need a title, your name, and a brief abstract - that's enough to get started!

Once you fill out an issue, we'll work with you on timing

### What do I talk about?

Anything!  Demo a module or function that you wrote, or that you use often.  Describe a helpful tip or trick that you think is worth sharing with the audience.  This is up to you!

Include info the audience will find helpful:

* What are you talking about?
* How does it work? This is a demo after all!
* Why might the audience use this?
* Where can they find more?

### How long do I talk?

Anything under 10 minutes!  Don't try to fill the whole 10 minutes, only show us what we need to see - only have 5 minutes of material?  Even better!

Oh.  In case it's not clear: it's a hard limit on 10 minutes.  If you need more time, consider talking at a local or remote user group!

### What happens the day of?

* Have your materials ready to present!
* Show up 15 minutes early.  We want to get everyone connected and make sure they can share their desktop and audio without issue
* Have fun!  Don't be too stressed.  It's just a couple minutes, and you'll have other peers joining you

### Do I have to answer questions?

Nope!  At least, not live; no time for that.  We'll encourage the community to follow up with you via...

* The twitter URL you include
* #powerhour in powershell.slack.com
* The issue for your demo

It would be awesome if you follow up on community questions in one of these spots

### Can you get awesome-person-xyz to do a demo?

We'll certainly be pestering folks, but if you know someone who has something awesome to talk about them, point them here and ask them to [submit a proposal](https://github.com/PSPowerHour/PSPowerHour/issues/new)!

### Can I pre-record a demo?

This part is tough.  We'll try to figure something out.  Short term, we'll need folks to demo things in person

To clarify - you can record something, and discuss things while playing it during the stream - we just don't have tooling to add an entire pre-recorded demo (speaking and screencap) yet.
