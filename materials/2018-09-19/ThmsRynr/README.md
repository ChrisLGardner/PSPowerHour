* **Title**: Writing and Deploying a VSTS Extension in 10 Minutes or Less
* **Abstract**: VSTS build and deploy extensions are incredibly powerful and flexible modules that can be installed from the Visual Studio marketplace, or developed and deployed yourself. In this no-slides-session, I'll show you how quickly you can get started writing and deploying your very own VSTS extensions.
