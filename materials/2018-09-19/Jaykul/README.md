* **Title**: ProxyCommands for fun and function
* **Abstract**: I'll demo how you can generate parameter blocks and even full command wrappers using the built-in ProxyCommand generator, and show how to safely modify proxy commands to add parameters and the functionality you need. I'll even highlight a few examples that are out in-the-wild.
