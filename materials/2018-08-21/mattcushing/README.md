* **Title**: Import Excel files to SQL Server in less than 20 lines of code, seriously!!
* **Abstract**: How I went from being frustrated with SSIS handling Excel files, to importing things with ease using modules and scripts in Powershell. No PS experience necessary because I don't really have any either (yet)! With a hand from some great people, I went from banging myhead against the wall to writing simple, straightforward code with the help of Import-Excel and dbatools modules in PS.
