* **Title**: Better, Safer SQL Queries from PowerShell
* **Abstract**: If you're working with SQL Server from PowerShell, either as a DBA, analyst, or anyone else running queries, you've probably used Invoke-SqlCmd. But depending on how you're building your queries, this can be error-prone or a huge security exposure! With the help of the dbatools module, I'll show you how to write and run these queries better and safer - and make them easier to work into your scripts to boot.
