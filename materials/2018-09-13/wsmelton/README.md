* **Abstract**: A walk-through of using VS Code to work with Docker for Windows (or Mac). If you are someone that has installed Docker for Windows but do not know where to start, using VS Code extension for Docker will help. The extension offers an easier way to interact with Docker images and containers. If you are more comfortable clicking than remembering all the command lines options for Docker...then this will get you started.
