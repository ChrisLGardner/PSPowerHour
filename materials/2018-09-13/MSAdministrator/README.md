* **Title**: Walkthrough my PSLogging PowerShell v5 Class
* **Abstract**: I will walkthrough a PowerShell v5 Class called PSLogging that I was supposed to present at PowerShell Summit 2018 but I ended up getting the flu twice within 2 weeks and forbidden to go by my doctor. Anyways, this will quickly walkthrough this PowerShell Class that allows you log to the Console, a Log File, or the Windows Event Viewer all within a single PowerShell Module.
