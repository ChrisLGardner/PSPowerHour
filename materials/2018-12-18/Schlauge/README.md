* **Title**: Using PowerShell to extend the GUI
* **Abstract**: If a vendor gives you a GUI or Tool that doesn't do what you want, you might be stuck!!  But if they offer a PowerShell module or (dare i say it) a PSSnapin, then you might just be in luck.  I'll quickly walk through a challenge I had with a Citrix process, then how I used Powershell to solve it.
This will be mainly about my discovery of the PowerShell Cmdlets offered by the vendor and how I go about making new discoveries in other vendor modules.
