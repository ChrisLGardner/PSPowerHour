* **Title**: PowerShell and RegExp to convert code
* **Abstract**: I had a project where I needed to convert more than 100K lines of code. Can you imaginethe pain of doing it all by hand? I have created an PowerShell function that uses regularexpression in order to do the find/replace and used it on +1000 individual files. I did in less than 2 weeks what I initial expected to be several months.  Note: I have used it to convert from Firebird SQL to T-SQL flavor but you can use it to other goals.
