# Notes
#######
# The quotation is intentional
  # It helps with some common quotation that might cause issues (e.g. a ' in the title)
  # Some guidelines [here](https://stackoverflow.com/a/22235064/3067642)
# If you use a newline in your Abstract (do you need to?), indent the next line as well
# Twitter, SlackID, and Blog are optional but help us and viewers find you!
# If you don't specify Twitter or SlackID, be sure to keep track of your GitHub notifications!
# Simple PowerShell function to generate this coming soon
